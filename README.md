# Cornucopia Website

This website documents how to use Cornucopia in your project.

## How to build

This project depends on both `mdbook` and `mdbook-admonish`. `mdbook-admonish` is a preprocessor used to add Material Design admonishments. You can learn more about it, and the instructions on how to install it, [here](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-admonish).

Once you've gotten mdbook-admonish and mdbook both installed, just run `mdbook build` after making changes and the website will be built automatically.
